Thanks to the discomfort I'm becoming a new person, the real me actually.

Here is a list of what is my new comfort now:
- Read one single book every day until I finish it
- Study one single topic every day for a month. Then change the topic.
- Stop sleeping late. Sleep at 10pm max and waking up at 4AM.
- No more junk food. Nutritious food only.
    - Cook my own food
    - Repeat the same plates every day
- No more social media. Only 10-15 minutes on sundays.
- Hit the gym by 5AM.
- 4-day martial arts training 3 hours every day.
