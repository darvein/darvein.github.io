I gotta be honest. I was not at my fullest this week.

I was back to procastinating everything again! :face_with_head_bandage:

Annoying things like:
- Being at computer until 3AM
- Skipping Lunch?... well not anymore, but eating non-healthy food
- Skipping reading (... a bunch of books actually)
- Skipping the development of my own projects
- Spending too much time on Social Networks
- Not going for a run just because of the rain

It was like this since last week and I've been fighting with myself to avoid this, today I'm trying to catch-up all my activities, all my duties, all my responsabilities and objectives.

I'm feeling better now, but not in a way that I'm more relaxed but proud of doing what sometimes I hate or don't want to do, I am on my way no.

Probably I can fallback again to procastination, I guess we are not inmune to our bad habits or what is highly dangerous to all of us **confort zone**.

Anyways, we will always find something in the way, the trick is to standup and keep moving forward.

I hope you all have a great week, although I don't know who read this lol :laughing:

Bye!
