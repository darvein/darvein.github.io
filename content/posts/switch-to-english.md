So, I've just decided to maintain my personal webpage in English only, I really need to master this language. I've been speaking this language in a mediocre way, I really wish I could improve it more and get better and better, there is no other way to archive that goal by practicing every day, speaking every day, writting every day, listening every day, that is the way to go. 

Starting from now I will share all I want to share in english, hopefully this help me a lot and I can have more readers obviosly :smile:

There is so much I would like to share and I just keep modifying my blog over and over, I will do my best to keep uploading more quality content and stop modiyfing my page's structure and styling.

Let's see how I can improve myself on the following months!

Best regards to you!
