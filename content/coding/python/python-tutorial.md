# Python Tutorial
Resource: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
Code snippets: https://github.com/darvein/code-snippets/tree/main/python/tutorial

## Overview
At first glance this teaches about:
- Basics: variables, operators and data types. Math, numbers, strings and lists
- Flow structures: if, for, while loops. break/continue
- Functions
- Data structures: lists, dicts, sets, tuples
- Modules, Packages and Classes
- Most popular libs: `math`, `random`, `datetime`, `statistics`, 
- Exceptions: `try`, `except`, `finally`
- Others: List comprehension, function decorators 

## Notes from Tutorial
### An Informal Introduction to Python
Simplier math operations, variables definition and strings manipulation. Also a little bit of lists.

## Some notes
Creator of this language is Guido Van Rossum, his main intention (besides a hobby project), was to create a programming language for everybody, literally that was his motivation and vision. I think he made it!.

From wikipedia:
> In 1999, Van Rossum submitted a funding proposal to DARPA called "Computer Programming for Everybody", in which he further defined his goals for Python.

### Python 2 vs Python 3! :boxing_glove:
This was done mainly to get a better maintenability of the code, lots of redundancies removed, code improved. But also breaks compatability.

Visibible from user developer perspective (?):
- No parenthesis for prints
- Float numbers for integer division
- All is Unicode
- Improved iterators (`range()`, `dict.keys()`)
- Standard libraries reorganized
- Error handling refactoring
