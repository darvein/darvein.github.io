**The Start**
Here is when I decided to start with Muay Thai, actually I've been teached that this is the ideal Martial Art if I want to go next with MMA. So I've got inspirations to start with Muay Thai, I mentalized myself. I'm killing my other me, the one that is weak, the one that has insecurities, the one that gives up easily, I want to become a new version of me, a better version, a strong one.

What a perfect timing to get into this Martial Arts world with a Seminar from Carlos Bazan (MMA Fighter).
