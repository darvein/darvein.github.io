# Atomic Habits

## tiny changes make a big difference
- the quality of our lives depend on the quality of our habits
- to write a great book you have to become the book
- results doesn't come quickly, habits are dismissed bcoz of that
- small changes can really impact in the future for good or bad
- pay attention to your life trajectory no that much on the results 
- in order to see results persistence is needed 
- forget about goals focus on systems instead, goals are the results and system is the process. 
- 1. Winners and losers have the same goals
- 2. Archiving a goal is momentary change
- 3. Goals restrict your happiness. Success is not happiness failure is ok
- 4. Goals are odds with long-term progress

- changing the outcomes, changing the process, changing identify. Get, do and believe
- believe drives actions
- start with believes and identity before defining goals and the habits
- the goal is not get something, the goal is to become something 
- habits and believes cannot be in conflict
- progress requieres unlearning
- You accumalte evidence (habits, actions) which later shapes your identity, day by day, habits by habit
- who you are, what you do
- bad habits happen,you can't be perfect. it's like voting, majority wins
- what a ZZZ person would do to get ZZZ?, Become thelat type of person, not to get particular outcome
- 
- habits are brain shortcuts from experience 
- good habits for finance, health
- cue, graving, response and reward. Is how habits work
- cue is linked to desire
- brain is a reward detector 
- cue obvious, craving attractive, response easy, reward satisfying. Laws. To break bad habits invert them 
- 

## make it obvious 
- habits can become unconscious
- make unconscious conscious
- point and call to help be conscious, self awareness 
- time and location defines a clue
- being specific and have a plan already before head makes habits simplier and effective 
- ditero effect, much people decides after what they just did. Chain on habits. Habit stacking. One habit triggers another
- environment affects planning on habits, shapes behaviour
