# Resources and priorities

First of all, size and measure mentally what you will do and how you will do it:

::: columns
:::: column
## Resources

- Costs
- Time
- Quality
::::

:::: column
## Priority

- Urgent
- Important
::::
:::

We can't always have high quality, cheap and fast, we have to trade off resources.

# Proactivity

Being proactive is really important nowadays, we are either part of the ones that think on the details or the ones that
are too distracted.

Traits?

- Anticipate to problems
- Communicate on-time
- Ask for help
- Be organized

# Archiving a result

In order to archive a result we have to basically consider the following aspects:

- Estimate
  - Be sure to know what you know and what you don't, do we need to research anything?
  - Make sure to understand what is the current scenario
  - Identify limitations and/or dependencies
- Before to start make sure we have cleared all the dependencies/blockers
- Test your result yoursefel
- Deliver
- Get a feedback

# Safe-fail when archiving the result

To fail is Ok

- Ask for help (colleages, forums, stackoverflow, etc)
- Think on alternatives (so you look like a hero)
- Communicate on-time
- You can fail to archive the result but you can't give up

# About habits

Being productive doesn't mean being generating products/results 24/7, you need to recharge yourself.

- Take care of your self:
  - Sleep
  - Eat
  - Exercise
  - Meditate?
- Have indoors/outdoors activities to distract or relax yourself
  - Learn to play a musical instrument
  - Read non-tech books, fictionals maybe?
  - Listen new music
  - Try something new, play video games
  - Go for a walk
  - Hangout with friends or family

# About habits

- Read online articles (aws blog, hackernews, hackingarticles)
- Share knowledge:
  - Write articles in a blog or PDF
  - Record a video
  - Present a talk on something you have learnt
- Night owls VS Early birds

# Frameworks and tooling

Tools should save you time, hence make your life easier

- A computer, a cellphone
- Software: insync/dropbox, spotify, xmind, vmware, aws, etc
- Books, E-books, Audiobooks: (amazon, packt)
- Online courses: Udemy, Acloudguru, Platzi, etc

# Time management

Time cannot always be managed as we want, we have to adapt to changes and iterate again to make sure we are in the right
track as we are supposed to be.

Some techniques that might help anyways:

- Pomodoro technique
- 5 minute rule
- Pareto principle

# Heros

- Bruce Lee
- Albert Einstein
- Charles Chaplin
