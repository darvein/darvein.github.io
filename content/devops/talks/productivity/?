# Productivity 101

- productivity = results

# Resources and priorities

First of all, size and measure mentally what you will do and how you will do it:

::: columns
:::: column
## Resources

- Costs
- Time
- Quality
::::

:::: column
## Priority

- Urgent
- Important
::::
:::

We can't always have high quality, cheap and fast, we have to trade off resources.

# Proactivity

Being proactive is really important nowadays, we are either part of the ones that think on the details or the ones that
are too distracted.

Traits?

- Anticipate to problems
- Communicate on-time
- Ask for help
- Be organized

# Archiving a result

In order to archive a result we have to basically consider the following aspects:

- Estimate
  - Be sure to know what you know and what you don't, do we need to research anything?
  - Make sure to understand what is the current scenario
  - Identify limitations and/or dependencies
- Before to start make sure we have cleared all the dependencies/blockers
- Test your result yoursefel
- Deliver
- Get a feedback

# Safe-fail when archiving the result

Fail is Ok, but is not if you don't communicate on time

- Ask for help (colleages, forums, stackoverflow, etc)
- Think on alternatives (so you look like an hero)
- Communicate on-time
- You can fail to archive the result but not give up
