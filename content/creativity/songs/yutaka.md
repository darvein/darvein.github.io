### 15-teen's night
Yeah, maybe the song name is incorrect, I'm trying to translate it to english from japanese. It basically talks about a boy who is fifteen years old, it talks about all the feelings he can go through in a single solitary night.

Last year (2022) I've been listening random music in youtube.com and I ended up with Yutaka's music, some people call him the Japanese Kurt Cobain :smile: - dumb people. Firstly I've noticed the emotion on how hi sings and the music melody, that was my style I liked it. 

Inmediately I searched for the lyrics and I've got suprised. 

Music it is not about finding lyrics that describe what exactly happened in your life, it is about connecting with the meaning, well, sometimes you have to give your own meaning to a song, but on this particular case, I started to remember when I was fiftheen: AVV School, first time to get lost while drinking, fall in love like if it were the first time. I don't remember exactly... but yeah, the first kiss from the hearth, walking solo in streets, seeing to people like shadows, feeling unconfortable being at home and family seeing you like a kid and me... myself feeling like a kid but also like a grown-young boy. 

I'm dreaming about the future, I'm dreaming about having it all, everything a boy can imagine, nothing material, just freedom. I had no big responsabilities, but I felt like I wanted to escape from jail. One part of me wanted to just walk relaxed in the city without thinking about the time, but my other me wanted to get in trouble, run, scream. One me wanted to be at home listening music but my other me wanted to be hanging out with friends, and my other me wanted to be with that special person, my girlfriend all the time.

I still remember that night at the roof of my house, with the cold wind in the face, staring at the starts and the moon, crying of happiness, trying to think on how I would look like in the future... but just trying, because I was happy enough to just live my present at that moment. I miss those days.
