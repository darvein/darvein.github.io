# As the world falls down

```
[Intro]
(A - F#m - D - Dm)

[Verse]
A
There's such a sad love
                                     F#m
Deep in your eyes, a kind of pale jewel
                                    D
Open and closed within your eyes
                   Dm             A
I'll place the sky within your eyes
 
A
There's such a fooled heart
                                     F#m
Beating so fast in search of new dreams
                                          D
A love that will last within your heart
                   Dm              A
I'll place the moon within your heart
 
 
[Chorus]
Bm
As the pain sweeps through
           Dm
Makes no sense for you
        A
Every thrill he's caused
         F#m                 A
Wasn't too much fun at all
                            F#7
But I'll be there for you-oo-oo
                         A
As the world falls down
F#m
Falling
D
(As the world) Falling down
Dm           A
Falling in love
 
[Verse]
I'll paint you mornings of gold
 
I'll spin you Valentine evenings
                 F#m
Though we're strangers till now
                                                D
We're choosing the path between the stars
Dm                                       A
I'll leave my love between the stars
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F#m
Falling
A
(As the world) Falling down
F#m
Falling 
                         A
As the world falls down
F#m
Falling
 
F#m                     A
Makes no sense at all
F#m                     A
Makes no sense to fall
 
F#m                      A
As the world falls down
 
(A - F#m - A - F#m - D - Dm)
