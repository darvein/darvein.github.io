I had nightmares with this one.
I don&amp;rsquo;t really enjoyed the whole story, but what kept me up watching this all afternoons were the visual effects, the creativity, the music. The story is Ok, its about a young girl that wants his brother back as a &amp;ldquo;dark prince&amp;rdquo; took with him all the way down to his magic castle.</description></item></channel></rss>
