I was not at my fullest this week.
I was back to procastinating everything again! &amp;#x1f915;
Annoying things like:
Being at computer until 3AM Skipping Lunch?&amp;hellip; well not anymore, but eating non-healthy food Skipping reading (&amp;hellip; a bunch of books actually) Skipping the development of my own projects Spending too much time on Social Networks Not going for a run just because of the rain It was like this since last week and I&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting with myself to avoid this, today I&amp;rsquo;m trying to catch-up all my activities, all my duties, all my responsabilities and objectives.</description></item><item><title>Improving Everyday</title><link>https://www.darvein.net/posts/improving-now/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.darvein.net/posts/improving-now/</guid><description>Hey yeah!
I&amp;rsquo;m loving difficult and challenging days. I&amp;rsquo;ve realized I had just few easy going and relaxing days in my life, I have noticed as well that most people have just few days of easy life, most people have many difficult days, most of us and yet we try to escape our own lives.
We should accept it, that is our nature, that is what we were born for. To accept live as it is, on its own terms, not ours.</description></item></channel></rss>
