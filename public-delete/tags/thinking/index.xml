I have heard million of times on blog posts, youtube and tiktok videos, books, famouse quotes, chatgpt, etc that we should focus on what is important for us. I already defined what is important for me, I know what is my North I know what is the path and I know how difficult it is, the only pending thing is to execute it like I&amp;rsquo;m doing it right now, the only thing I need to do is to be CONSISTENT every single and fck1ng day.</description></item></channel></rss>
