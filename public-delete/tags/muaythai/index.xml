I started with Muay Thai, it was somewhat hard at the beginning for me as I didn&amp;rsquo;t practice marial arts in the right way before. I tried a little bit of Ninjutsu, Taekwondo, Karate but never commited more than one month to each&amp;hellip;
Now I&amp;rsquo;ve been 3 months (or 4?) already on it and I really regret not being training from my 20s &amp;#x1f622;, anyways, never is late I still have the opportunity to go and train no matter the age, although I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can do anything competitive&amp;hellip; that is for young people that are on their 20s.</description></item></channel></rss>
