</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>[Verse 2]
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>It&#39;s been twenty-two long, hard years, I&#39;m still strugglin&#39;
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Survival got me buggin&#39;
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>But I&#39;m alive on arrival, I peep at the shape of the streets
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>And stay awake to the ways of the world &#39;cause **** deep
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>A man with a dream with plans to make cream
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Which failed, I went to jail at the age of fifteen
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>A young buck sellin&#39; drugs and such, who never had much
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Tryin&#39; to get a clutch at what I could not touch (Touch)
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>The court played me short, now I face incarceration
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Pacin&#39;, goin&#39; upstate&#39;s my destination
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Life as a shorty shouldn&#39;t be so rough
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Livin&#39; in the world no different from a cell
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Every day I escape from jakes givin&#39; chase
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Sellin&#39; base, smokin&#39; bones in the staircase
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Though I don&#39;t know why I chose to smoke sess
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>I guess that&#39;s the time when I&#39;m not depressed
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>But I&#39;m still depressed, and I ask, what&#39;s it worth?
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Ready to give up, so I seek the old Earth
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Who explained workin&#39; hard may help you maintain
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops and crack rocks
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Leave it up to me while I be livin&#39; proof
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>To kick the truth to the young Black youth
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>But shorty&#39;s runnin&#39; wild, smokin&#39; sess, drinkin&#39; beer
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>And ain&#39;t tryna hear what I&#39;m kickin&#39; in his ear
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>That what? That life is hectic
